Hi, I'm Oleg.

I use linux(arch btw.) as main os for 3 years. Now I'm making my own server and use IaC(Ansible, Terraform and etc.). 
Write gem in Ruby that compares two playlists from spotify and show's matched songs(more than 1000 downloads).
Was writing labs in univercity on C, C++, C#, Python.
Also know Go on a basic level.

My projects:
